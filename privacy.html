  </p>
<p>We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.<p>
<h1>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h1>
<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at:
<a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">lhttp://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a>
   </p>
<p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:
Users can visit our site anonymously
Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.
Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</p>
<p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:</p>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
      </ul>
<p>Users are able to change their personal information:</p>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li>By logging in to their account</li>
      </ul>
<h1>How does our site handle do not track signals?</h1>
<p>We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>
<h1>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</h1>
<p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking</p>
<h1>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h1>
<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.<p>
<p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>
<h1>Fair Information Practices</h1>
<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
<h1>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</h1>
<p>We will notify the users via email</p>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li>Within 7 business days</li>
      </ul>
<p>We will notify the users via in site notification</p>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li>Within 7 business days</li>
      </ul>
<p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
